# Stream Deck SF Symbols icons

# Building Locally

This package gets all its icons from Apples original repository [SF Symbols 3.2](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)
I have removed the basic "number" icons intentionally.

This tool creates four variants of the icons: monochrome, hierarchical, palette and multicolor.

## Install dependencies
